            <p class="DFont FC1">A slow computer will make your productivity slower. Imagine using a machine, its screen frozen in time as if caught in a perpetual state of contemplation. Opening a program was an exercise in patience, the loading icon spinning endlessly as if lost in an eternal loop. This can cause severe irritation on your part and worst-case possible, will make your day worst than ever since you can't do your work/school works. </p>
            <p class="DFont FC1">This guide will help you what method or acts should you do in order to lessen your computer slowing down performance, not permanently removing it, but decreasing its wearing down, sluggish presentation.</p>
